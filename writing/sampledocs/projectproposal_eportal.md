# 1. Project Name: E-Portal

# 2. Vision:
On 30th July, 2024 we launched E-Portal that aids editors write content faster and in more streamlined fashion. Currently, the process for writing an article for nbnw requires editors to go to dynamodb and update it over there. This is error prone and causes issues with backend and frontend integration leading to website crashes quite a number of times.

Learning from our mistakes we did create a mechanism to allow only developer go and update the dynamodb but it is still a point of concern causing us to waste developer efforts and time. Furthermore, this causes untimely delivery of resources making it even difficult for us to scale in the way we want.

Launch of E-Portal will all the editors at NBNW a central place to work, review, research and collaborate with each other allowing us to produce quality results faster. With it's launch, we were able to see article launch speed from 5 articles per week (apw)/individual to 9 apw/individual.


# 3. FAQ:
#### 1. Wouldn't it become even difficult for editors to adapt to new tool? 
Tool was made with editors in mind for which we consulted our UI/UX team to take special care about.

#### 2. How is it going to help the editors?
By providing a set of templates to work with during the article creation process and making it more engaging this tool will help editors focus on content rather than structure and work more efficiently.

#### 3. How is the review process going to work?
If I write an article, every other editor except me can see that article for review. This helps other editors to get quick visibility to the articles pending review.

#### 4. What if no one reviews my articles? 
We will be adding an escalate button to ensure accountability. Once the article is escalated, there should be a notification sent to management.

#### 5. What are we doing to avoid escalation?
Editors will be required to review equivalent number of articles to post an article. (Otherwise post an article with escalation) This will help us keep accountability while avoiding escalations.

#### 6. How do we plan to maintain quality for review and approval process?
We will be working on a tool that rates the article internally. If we find a poorly written article getting approved by someone, we will flag the individual and appropriate next steps will be taken.
